# Automated Code Generation and Testing with OpenAI Codex and GitHub Integration

This Rust-based application is a skeleton project that aims to leverage the OpenAI Codex API for generating code snippets based on user-provided function requirements. The application also integrates with GitHub for branch management and updates. The project is a work in progress and will be developed over time, with more features and improvements added in future iterations.

## Key Features

1. Automated code generation using OpenAI Codex API (to be implemented).
2. Continuous testing feedback loop for error-free code (to be implemented).
3. Integration with GitHub for branch management and updates (to be implemented).

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and follow the setup instructions to install the necessary libraries and dependencies.
